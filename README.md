# De'Longhi My Coffee Lounge (Daedalus) — Home Assistant Integration

Home Assistant custom integration for **modern De'Longhi machines** that ship the
**My Coffee Lounge** app (package `com.delonghigroup.daedalus`) — most notably
the **Eletta Ultra**.

> ⚠️ **Status: alpha / experimental.** Auth + LAN handshake work, brewing commands
> are not yet decoded. Only useful right now if you can help capture an MITM trace
> of the official app — see [issue #18 on the upstream repo](https://github.com/sk7n4k3d/delonghi-ha/issues/18).

This integration is the **Daedalus stack** counterpart to
[`delonghi-ha`](https://github.com/sk7n4k3d/delonghi-ha) (which targets the older
**Coffee Link / Ayla Networks** machines like the Eletta Explore). The two stacks
share *nothing* at the wire-protocol level, so they live in two separate
integrations / repos.

## Which one do I need?

| Your app | Use this integration |
|---|---|
| **Coffee Link** (older, Ayla cloud) | [`delonghi-ha`](https://github.com/sk7n4k3d/delonghi-ha) |
| **My Coffee Lounge** (newer, AWS IoT, BLE provisioning, Eletta Ultra) | **this repo** |

If your machine is on Coffee Link don't install this integration — install
the upstream `delonghi-ha` instead.

## Installation (HACS)

1. In HACS → **Integrations** → ⋮ → **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/sk7n4k3d/delonghi-daedalus-ha` as **Integration**
3. Find **De'Longhi My Coffee Lounge (Daedalus)** in the list, install
4. Tick **"Show beta versions"** and pick the latest `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N` or
   `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` — the integration is pre-alpha right now and only ships
   prereleases until brewing commands are decoded
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → De'Longhi My Coffee Lounge**

## Configuration

You'll need:

- **My Coffee Lounge** account email + password
- **LAN IP** of the machine (look it up on your router or in the official app)
- **Serial number** printed on the machine (sticker on the side / underside)
- **Region** — the integration auto-probes EU / EU_US / CH on `403005` errors,
  so leave on EU unless you know your account was created in another pool

The password is **not** persisted — only the long-lived Gigya session token and
the JWT are stored on disk. Home Assistant's native reauth flow asks for the
password again on the rare occasion the session token is revoked.

## Security notes

- LAN connections use TLS with a self-signed certificate (the firmware presents
  one). The integration accepts the cert via `verify_mode=CERT_NONE` but **only**
  if the host you configure is a numeric IP in a private / loopback / link-local
  range. Public IPs and hostnames are rejected — auth credentials in the WebSocket
  AUTH frame would otherwise be MITM-able.
- All Gigya API keys hardcoded in `const.py` are extracted from the public APK
  manifest — equivalent to OAuth client IDs, not secrets.
- A diagnostics endpoint is wired so you can attach a `Download diagnostics` zip
  to GitHub issues without leaking your JWT, session token, email, or serial
  number — those are scrubbed in the payload.

## What works today

- ✅ Gigya login + JWT retrieval (auto-probe across pools)
- ✅ LAN WebSocket handshake (`/ws/lan2lan`) with AUTH frame
- ✅ HA reauth flow + diagnostics
- ✅ Connection-state binary sensor + LAN ID / SN / IP diagnostic sensors

## What does NOT work yet

- ❌ Brewing commands (need an MITM trace of the official app to decode the
  `Message` catalog — help wanted, see upstream issue #18)
- ❌ Cloud `/devices` discovery (you must manually enter the SN + IP)
- ❌ AWS IoT MQTT shadow polling for offline machines (LAN only for now)

## Source of truth

The integration code lives in the upstream
[`delonghi-ha` monorepo](https://github.com/sk7n4k3d/delonghi-ha) under
`custom_components/delonghi_daedalus/`. This repo is **a packaging mirror** for
HACS distribution — releases here are cut from the upstream `master` branch.

Open issues, PRs, and contribute on the upstream repo.

## License

Same as upstream `delonghi-ha`. Reverse-engineering for personal HA
interoperability with hardware you own.
